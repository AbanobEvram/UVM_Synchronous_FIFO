# UVM_Synchronous_FIFO
This project focuses on verifying a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) design using UVM. It includes write-only, read-only, reset, and main sequences, along with SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA) and a scoreboard to ensure correct functionality. The testbench addresses key scenarios such as underflow, overflow, and reset behavior verification
